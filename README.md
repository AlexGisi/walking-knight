# walking-knight
A knight moves in an L on a chess board. Given two squares, how can a knight traverse between them?

Once we have a move generator, we can answer that question with a breadth-first search. This app lets you visualize the resulting path for any two squares.

To use:
```
pip install flask
python3 run.py
```
And visit the index page in your favorite modern browser.
